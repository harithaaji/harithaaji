## üíº Projects

### Public Health Disease Surveillance Architecture Development Project
- **Description:** This Project involves the creation of a virtual machine environment for the Public Health Disease Surveillance Architecture Development Project. It serves as a secure space for testing network architecture and advancements. The project includes the development of five virtual machines and the implementation of a Health Information Exchange (HIE). The foundational architecture will feature five virtual machines, encompassing four hospital systems and one Unified Public Health Information Exchange (UPHIE).
- **Skills/Technologies Used:** Virtualization,Network Architecture, MySQL,Linuz Administration,Python Used RESTful APIs for data exchange between different systems,Knowledge of security principles and practices for ensuring data confidentiality, integrity, and availability in surveillance systems,Skills in scripting languages,Data Analysis and Visualization,Geographic Information Systems (GIS),Basic understanding of epidemiological principles and disease surveillance methods for designing effective surveillance systems,HL7 FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources),Hapi-FHIR.
- - - - ### population Health Research Project:** Emerging Research: Measles
- **Description:** This research project focuses on analyzing the resurgence of measles over the past four years and its implications for healthcare infrastructure. It explores existing countermeasures against this major infectious disease from the 20th century and investigates opportunities for modernizing disease surveillance systems. Additionally, the project aims to implement participatory health informatics (PHI) techniques to address declining immunization rates. It also examines the effects of social media trends on measles awareness and vaccination efforts.
